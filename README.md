# Used-Car-Prediction-in-India
- This is my first notebook to play a little bit with different ml-algorithms. 
The goal is to clean and preprocess the data, also to compare LinearRegression, DecissionTree and RandomForest. 
- The structure is as following:
- Loading the Data and getting first intuitions
- Identifiying missing values
- Plausibility check of numerical attributes
- Checking values of categorical attributes
- Checking the amount of data after rough cleansing
- Data Cleaning (Filtering, Replacing NaN-Values, LabelEncoder)
- Training and comparing Models
- Cross-Validation
- Final prediction and Conclusion

- This Notebook was my first touch with machine learning. It was meant as a first hands on, instead of realizing the best model. But i think a score of 0.88 is not that bad at all. I've learned that the predictions of the training set are vague and cross validation is undispensable. Furthermore RandomForest seems to be a good choice for this dataset. Playing with a little bit more hyperparamters and better data cleaning should squeeze better results.
